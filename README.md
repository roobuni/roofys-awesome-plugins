## hi this is my awesome repo containing all my plugins that i have made.
## BulkMessageDelete
A Vencord plugin that lets you mass delete your own messages from DMs, group chats, and servers, also contains fast searching to only filter messages that contain specific words. its pretty freaking fast!
## Features

### Quick Wipe
Right-click any DM, group chat, or server channel and hit "Bulk Wipe Messages" (or "Bulk Wipe My Messages" for servers). You'll get a menu with options to:

- wipe all
- wipe attachments
- wipe filtered
- preview mode

There's also export options if you want to save your messages before deleting (JSON or TXT).

### Scheduled Auto-Delete
for more privacy focused users, you can set it up to automatically delete your messages after a delay. Enable scheduled wipe in settings and configure delay like `5h`, `1d 10h`, `2d` to automatically delete your messages after a delay:

- exclude specific users
- works across DMs and servers and it will sync missed messages on startup
- stats in settings show what's pending and the cache size (i mean i added that just for me but it might be useful for you)

## autodeletewelcome
this plugin is super simple, it just deletes the welcome message instantly upon joining a server. if you dont like getting sticker spammed.

## channelLogger
message logger but awesome, you can see deleted channels and its message contents, it will be marked red and you can right click to delete once you saw what you needed to see.

## XLaccountSwitcher

most useful plugin for people who do silly things to servers, it allows you to switch accounts easily and manage them in a simple interface, you can right click any user in any chat to access it. most noteble features includes

- mass import
- auto move invaild accounts to invaild tab (you can delete them there or click retry)
- add individual and set a nickname
- ## SWITCHING ACCOUNTS WILL CLEAR THE CURRENT ACCOUNTS YOU HAVE IN THE NATIVE ACCOUNT SWITCHER SINCE IT CLEARS ACCOUNT SWITCHER KEYS FOR EACH TIME YOU SWITCH ACCOUNTS USING THE PLUGIN, SO BACK UP YOUR ACCOUNTS FIRST!!!!
- search accounts by nickname or token
- copy tokens


## letmesee

this one was kind of hard to make since yea. this plugin allows you to constantly see messages in channels that dont have the message history permission. it will cache any and all messages in that channel with that specific permission so you can see them even after you reload discord, you can clear the cache in settings and exclude specific servers from being cached.


## makeshifteveryone 

just add a button in the context menu that pastes all user ids in the text box, i recommended turning off syntax markdowns in settings to copy the ids.

## catboxUploader

a new button in the attachment context menu and textbox context menu that allows you to bypass discords 10mb limit! discord free users can click on "Upload video to Catbox" to you know! do that. this has its own upload system, completely bypassing discords upload system to avoid the upsell prompts. so free discord users can now upload up to 200 mb instend of 10, nitro users can tick "Auto Catbox for Videos" if they just perfer uploading it there. you can disable toasts in plugin settings. this only supports videos only.
